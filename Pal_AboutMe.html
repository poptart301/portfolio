               My name is Pobtam Pal. I am a freshman from Dublin High School in Dublin, California. One idea I always thought of and chased after was becoming a musical artist. I would like to show my friends, family, peers, and people all around the world my songs and music. I plan to release my music through platforms that many people use to listen to music such as Soundcloud.
           <br>
           <br>
               From taking guitar lessons with my former guitar teacher I have learned how to be more organized. Not only did I learn a instrument that I am very skilled at now, I also learned to be motivated, responsible, and to be honest to myself and others.
           <br>
           <br>
               Using the skills I have learned from my guitar lessons I joined my middle school's jazz band and became the lead guitarist for Wells Middle School's Jazz Band. Over the summer I started writing my own music. After half a month I had finished my first song. Not long after the first song was created another melody appeared and became a song. Now I have four songs that I have written and made by myself.
           <br>
           <br>
               As a young student I aspire to make more music that will be heard and appreciated by others. Thank you for listening to the first part of the story. Please join me in the adventure yet to come.
